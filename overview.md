## 1. Game Overview

### 1.1 Concept
Repentance is a single-player survival game. Trapped in a maze with vengeful monsters that were once victims of the player’s family, the player’s primary objective is to stay alive for 5 minutes. At the same time, the player’s role is to confront their family’s dark past and make decisions that could shape their own fate.

### 1.2 Genre
Repentance is a survival horror game. The player is challenged to survive for 5 minutes while trapped in the maze by either hiding or running from the monsters. The game sets up suspense by making use of horror game elements such as spine-chilling graphics, dark environments, unexpected attacks and eerie sound effects.

### 1.3 Target Audience
Set in a maze with horror elements, the game is targeted at players who are drawn to experiencing thrill in a controlled environment. Additionally, the 5-minute time constraint on the game makes it suitable for players who prefer or can only afford to play in short bursts.

### 1.4 Unique Selling Points

#### 1.4.1 Compelling Storyline
Repentance follows a storyline that progressively unfolds as the game scales in difficulty. The player’s role is not only to survive, but also to uncover the gruesome truth about their family and face the consequences of their past actions. The intertwining of survival and story progression creates an immersive experience that keeps players emotionally engaged.

#### 1.4.2 Appealing Aesthetic
Inspired by the dystopian science fiction film ‘Maze Runner’ (left), the game features a pixelated maze-like environment where the walls are overgrown with foliage (right). The pixelated graphics style creates a nostalgic retro feel while the foliage, just as it conceals the features of the maze, symbolizes the hidden secrets and dangers that lurk in the player’s world.

#### 1.4.3 Unique Mechanics
Other than the standard player health, Repentance includes player stamina as a gameplay mechanic that reflects a realistic physical limitation of the player’s character and heightens the challenge of the game. Stamina allows the player to run away from the monsters and gradually replenishes when the player walks. Having to balance multiple resources adds depth to the gameplay and encourages the player to think strategically.

## Game Mechanics

### Player Perspective
First-person perspective where the player’s view is defined by the camera. The player is able to move the camera to create the impression that they are looking around the game. The player’s character is largely not visible on the screen. Only the arms will be seen to further enhance the impression of a first-person perspective. This perspective choice enhances the horror genre of the game as the player becomes the character and the limited field of view intensifies the uncertainty of the maze.

#### Progression
The player becomes trapped within the maze when the game begins and they must survive 5 minutes until the sun rises in order to win.
The maze is broken into three main sections each containing different enemies. Each enemy has a different attack style and the player must avoid these enemies as one attack from any enemy will kill the player. 
Throughout the maze the player will find tombstobes that belong to the enemy. The player will have the opportunity to interact with the tombstone and destory it. Destroying a tombstone will reveal part of the game's backstory, however it will anger the ghost and make the game more difficult for the player. The player will also come across different NPCs throughout the maze. The player can interact with the NPCs in the form of a conversation with multiple options that will have different impacts on the difficulty of the game. The game may become easier or harder for the player depending on the choices they make.

#### Gameplay Mechanics
The player is able to walk (using WASD) or sprint (using WASD + shift). The sprint capability is limited by a stamina bar that is depleted and slowly refilled. Additionally, the player is able to use the F key to equip a flashlight in areas of the maze that are dark too dark for the player to be able to see in. The player will come across different tombstones and NPCs throughout the maze that they can interact with using the E key.
The limitation of the sprint ability, along with the use of different light levels within the maze will make the game more challenging for the player.
